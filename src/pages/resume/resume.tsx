        <p className="h4 fst-italic">I like building clean and straightforward user experiences. <span className="h5 fst-normal fade-in__right" style={{animationDelay: "0.1s"}}>That extends to building systems that are not just functional, but also maintainable and scalable. To me, it starts with writing clean, readable code, supported by good test coverage.</span></p>

        <p className="h5 fade-in__right" style={{animationDelay: "0.2s"}}>One of my favourite things about programming is seeing the different components of a well-structured system come together. I also enjoy solving problems through logical thinking. Over time, however, I've learned that <strong>the best solutions don't just depend on technical elegance</strong>. They also need to consider real-world constraints like time, maintainability, and how easily it can be communicated to others.</p>
        <br />
        <p className="h5 fade-in__right" style={{animationDelay: "0.3s"}}>I believe that good teams have a <strong>clear purpose</strong> and <strong>clearly defined roles</strong> so that everyone is able to make their highest level of contribution. Feel free to reach out if you are building a team with this in mind!</p>
